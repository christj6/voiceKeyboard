=============

Created in October 2011. Uses Processing, gsnap and Minim.
I recorded wav files of me humming, used gsnap to snap the pitch to the notes I was trying to sing, and mapped them all to the keyboard. 'z' corresponds to C4, 's' corresponds to C#4, ... ',' corresponds to C5.

I tried increasing the attack on the audio files for a gentler fade-in, but they still end abruptly, and it's difficult to know when the user will release the key. Also, the files don't loop, so if different notes of a chord enter at different times, one last "me" might be left holding the one note. It was an interesting experiment.
